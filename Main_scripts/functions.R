# Functions to run counterfactual simulation and assign a quantity of responsibility to each of several causes.
# 1) function that calculates all possible observations of the causes ('worlds').
# Needs inputs of:
# -- cause variables, assuming these happen either 0,1 and their strengths, assuming in a vector of prob 0, prob 1
# -- causal structure, whether disjunctive or conjunctive

# 2) function that gets conditional probabilities 

# 3) function to get counterfactuals and effect size:
# -- simulates counterfactuals by resampling from the prior for vars with p=1-s where s=stability to real world.
# -- prints out correlation of effect with each causal variable across these simulated counterfactual worlds.

# Notes on realLatent
# Sometimes the values of the unobserved variables can be inferred logically. These are NOT 'realLatent'.
# realLatent is when we genuinely don't know what values the unobserved variables take. (when poss >1 in the function `get_cond_probs`)
# It affects the following situations (easier to point out when it is NOT realLatent, and take the inverse)
# All are realLatent, except:
# c5: Au and Bu
# d2: Bu
# d3: Bu
# d4: Au
# d5: Au
# d6L Au and Bu
